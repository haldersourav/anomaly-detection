# Anomaly detection algorithms
A set of five anomaly detection algorithms are described as well as compared here. The purpose of this webapp is to demonstrate how Plotly-Dash can be used for data visualization as well as offer a template for other interactive visualization. The five anomaly detection algorithms are as follows:
1) Robust covariance
2) One-class Support Vector Machine (SVM)
3) One-class SVM Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
4) Isolation Forest
5) Local Outlier Factor
